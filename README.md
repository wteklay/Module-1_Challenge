# Module-1_Challenge
Assignment using Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

## Overview of the Project 
Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, seeks to fund her new play **Fever** and requires some statstical data to set a reasonable budget. It will helpful to Louise to determine specific factors that make similar campaign's successful. The goal is to help her campaign mirror other successful projects of similar nature. 

### Purpose
The project aims to help Louise understand how different campaigns, specifically theatre, performed in relation to its launch date and funding goals. The report will consist of two visuals titled **Outcomes based on Launch Date** and **Outcomes Based on Goals chart**. Data obtained from these two analyses will help Louise understand how outcomes (success, failure, cancellation) differ by launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Two analyses are performed as described above. **Outcomes based on Launch Date** is constructed by creating a pivot table from the raw dataset *Kickstarter*  and by graphing a line chart to see the correlation between theatre outcomes and launch dates. Date defined by years is plotted on the x-axis and the count of total successful, failed and canceled outcomes are plotted on the y-axis. Similarity, **Outcomes based on funding goals** is obtained by pooling raw data and computing the percentage of sucessful, failed and canceled projects on the Y-axis and range of funding goals on the X-axis by a factor of $5,000. Results are attached below.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some difficulties encountered include uploading images in the README.md template that works properly and interpretating the analysis without much information on how it was collected. 

## Results
Based on the analysis of **Outcomes Based on Launch Date**, the month of May appears to feature the most successful campiagns as well as failures , while the month of December features the least count of both, successful and failed campiagns. Louise should consider launching her campiagn between the months of March-May as the trend of succesful campiagns increases within those months. 

Based on the analysis of **Outcomes Based on Goals**, campiagns that aimed to raise between 35K-45K are 67% successful, while campiagns that aimed to raise less than 1K are the most successful (76%), and campiagns that wanted to raise between 1K-5K re 73% successful. On the same token, campiagns that aimed to raise more than 45K are the least successful. 

## Limitations
Data does not measure or report the number of staffers hired nor the process behind securing pledges to fund campagins. This will help Louise understand the external factors that lie outside the reported measures (time, country...). 

## Other Posibilities 
Possible graphs that can be helpful to Louise are
