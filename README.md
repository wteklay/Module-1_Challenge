# Module-1_Challenge
Assignment using Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

## Overview of the Project 
Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, seeks to fund her new play **Fever** and requires some statstical data to set a reasonable budget. It will helpful to Louise to determine specific factors that make similar campaign's successful. The goal is to help her campaign mirror other successful projects of similar nature. 

### Purpose
The project aims to help Louise understand how different campaigns, specifically theatre, performed in relation to its launch date and funding goals. The report will consist of two visuals titled **Outcomes based on Launch Date** and **Outcomes Based on Goals chart**. Data obtained from these two analyses will help Louise understand how outcomes (success, failure, cancellation) differ by launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Two analyses are performed as described above. **Outcomes based on Launch Date** is constructed by creating a pivot table from the raw dataset *Kickstarter*  and by graphing a line chart to see the correlation between theatre outcomes and launch dates. Date defined by years is plotted on the x-axis and the count of total successful, failed and canceled outcomes are plotted on the y-axis. Similarity, **Outcomes based on funding goals** is obtained by pooling raw data and computing the percentage of sucessful, failed and canceled projects on the Y-axis and range of funding goals on the X-axis by a factor of $5,000. Results are attachede below.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
